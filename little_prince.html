    <h1>The Little Prince</h1>

    <p>
      The Little Prince is a novella written by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
      It tells the story of a young prince who travels from planet to planet,
      learning lessons about life, love, and human nature.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though written as a children’s story, the book explores deeper themes
      such as responsibility, imagination, and what truly matters in life.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most famous lessons from the book is that
      <em>“what is essential is invisible to the eye.”</em>
